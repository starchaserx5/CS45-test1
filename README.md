Computerized Proofs via Truth Tables

 

CS 006 and CS 045 both cover Boolean Algebra, and each class does a form of proofs to show that two logical expressions are equivalent. One method, which is Truth Tables, is easy to implement as a program; regardless of the language used (i.e Python, et al, can do it too but C++ is better). The method is to create Truth Tables for each of the logical expressions. If the output of the Truth Tables are identical for the identical input, then the two logical expressions have been proven to be equivalent.

Once we show that two logical expressions are equivalent, we can use either of them at any point in time; sometimes a shorter expression takes longer to compute than a longer expression, especially if the shorter expression has parentheses in it.

As such, the task is to create a program (in C++, Python, BASIC, BASH, AWK, Perl, but NOT Java! -- no classes are allowed, hence no Java!), without the aid of programmer-developed classes (this means that you cannot create a class and that the program has to conform to a CS 002-style program, BUT, any header file on cplusplus.com can be used!) The program shall  meet these specifications:

The name of the program shall be truthTable
The program must be able to accept up to 26 Boolean variables (A to Z) for each expression.
The user of the program need not necessarily have variables that "run in sequence;" meaning A, B, C are good input, A, Q, Z is also good input. (HINT: A boolean array of 26 elements can be indexed by (int)(x - 65) where x is a character from A to Z. (Note: this implies that all input must be converted to upper case!)
The program must be able to hold an unlimited number of expressions (HINT: vectors)
All expressions are entered as C++ strings
The operators, whose precedence is in your text,  will be:
Parentheses
Conjunction will be represented by &
Disjunction will be represented by |
NOT will be represented by an tilde (~)
NAND will be represented by @
NOR will be represented by %
XOR will be represented by ^
Implication will be represented by =>
Bi-implication will be represented by <=>
The program shall store the Boolean Expression in two forms; the original form as entered and in "Boolean Reverse Polish" format. (HINT: a two dimensional array of vectors of type C++ string will handle this. The RPN format will make "computing" the expression much, much, much, much, much easier!)
To enter an expression, the user will enter NEW followed by the Boolean expression The program will respond with EXPRESSION x entered (where x is the index of the expression in the vector plus 1)
To delete an expression, the user will enter DELETE x, where x is the expression number.
To print out a Truth Table for an expression, the use will enter TABLE x, where x is the expression number.
To see if two expressions are "identical," the user will enter IS x = y?, where x and y are the numbers of the expressions. If the two are expression are identical, then the program will print out the first expression, then the words "is equivalent to," then the second expression. If the two expressions are not identical, the  word "not" will be used ("is not equivalent to")
To see all expressions, the user shall type LIST
To store all expressions to a file, the user will type STORE and then a filename. If the file already exists, the program must notify the user that it does and ask if they want to erase the current file or give another filename. All filenames for this program must be of the format filename.truth. If the user does not enter .truth after the filename, the program must automatically do it for the user.
All output (Truth Tables, etc) must be visually appealing (HINT: iomanip, and T and F must be used in the table for output)
To load expressions from a file, the user will type LOAD and then a file name. The rules specified in number 13 apply here too.
To edit an expression (meaning to change it without entering a new expression), the user will enter EDIT x, where x is the expression number. The program will then query the user for a new expression.
The program ends whenever the user enters EXIT or QUIT. When exiting, the program must ask the user if they want to safe all of the current expressions if and only if the user did not save the expressions right before asking the program to end.
If the user types WEXIT filename or WQUIT filename, this will write the file and exit the program.
If the user enters HELP, then the program will write out the precedence relations as well as instructions on each command, and so forth.
This program will require the use of two dimensional arrays, vectors, C++ strings (and a lot of the C++ string manipulators!), iomanip, and some other headers. (bitmap may be of some use, but not necessarily)

Algorithm to Convert Boolean Algebra to RPN:

Edsger Dijkstra (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site., one of the pilars of Computer Science, invented the Shunting-yard algorithm (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. to convert infix expressions to postfix (RPN), so named because its operation resembles that of a railroad shunting yard. The link above is crucial to solving this problem.

In order to implement the Shunting-yard algorithm, you will be needing  to use the stack header file. Stacks will be discussed in class. You may work in teams of two, but each must submit their own to Canvas. Be prepared to demonstrate the program during lab!

 

Extra Credit:

(50 points) When the user enters NEWTABLE, the program will ask how many variables are to be in the table. Then, it will print out each row of the Truth Table (from all zeros to all ones), waiting for the user at the end of each row to enter what the result would be for that row. When all rows are completed, the program will then respond with what expression the table represents and state that this expression has been stored as Expression x.

Example:

Suppose the following were to be entered as the inputs for each row of a two-variable truth table:

FF F
FT T
TF T
TT F

The program would then respond with ~A&B | A&~B as the equation that would have this  Truth Table

 

(150 points) You and your partner complete ALL requirements, and the above Extra Credit, by the 1st of November.
